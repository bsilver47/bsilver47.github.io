                <p>
                    Having been interacting with software from a place of
                    development and creativity for nearly a decade, I naturally
                    find myself drawn towards certain paths and fields. Some of
                    which, that I will discuss here, include Backend Software
                    Engineering, Mobile Engineering, and Communications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When it comes to software engineering, I have the utmost
                    respect for those who can make things look pretty, but my
                    focus tends to be on making things work. If this involves
                    full-stack development, I can manage, as demonstrated during
                    my tenure at UVU (please see my resume page and github for
                    some of the details on this topic), but I primarily approach
                    software engineering from a place of trying to best deliver
                    the functionality offered by the desired tool. For me, the
                    elegance of trying to deliver the best, most efficient
                    product through hand-curated data is an art form that,
                    ironically, appeals to me more than making things look
                    appealing. As a result of this mindset, I naturally
                    gravitate towards engineering the backend of nearly any
                    service, but especially in the fields that I am the most
                    passionate about, such as medical technologies,
                    telecommunications, and international relations; as will be
                    discussed later in this page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have always been enamored by mobile technologies and their
                    ability to streamline the process of accessing information
                    on a day-to-day basis. From making watchfaces and apps for
                    my smartwatch as a teenager to making a calculator
                    application, of sorts, as a means of taking notes in
                    university physics class, I have enjoyed ensuring that
                    access to information is never restricted to a desktop or
                    library environment. In recent years, I have taken a notable
                    liking to GIS and library applications and websites as a
                    means of accessing copious amounts of information freely
                    from anywhere and, in ideal circumstances, at anytime. If I
                    could have a career built on the idea of helping in these
                    endeavors, as highlighted, I would be quite happy.

                    As an amateur radio operator or, perhaps, as an extension of
                    the reasons I gave for my fondness of mobile engineering, I
                    am particularly partial to the fields of communcations,
                    telecommunications, and signals; here collectively referred
                    to as communications. A generous portion of my time at BYU
                    was dedicated to focusing on how to adapt a protocol
                    designed for the internet to a true Over-The-Air setting or
                    medium. Part of this was the designated task of attempting
                    to use the protocol with satellite communications, allowing
                    for more free use of communications of nearly all varieties
                    in restricted or remote areas. Another aspect of this was
                    the elected task of attempting to facilitate use of the
                    protocol in lower frequencies, allowing for easier consumer
                    and amateur access from remote and destabalized locations.
                    The intention of both compontents was to aid in the
                    facilitation of more reliable communication - that no
                    singular event could restrict the ability for anyone to
                    access what they need.
                </p>

                    As indicated, each of these three fields play into three
                    main industries for me: medical, communications, and
                    international relations. Each of these, and more, are
                    industries I would be particularly hopeful to pursue in my
                    career. To give an idea of what this might look like, I
                    would like to discuss one of my favorite interactions from
                    my time employeed by Cox Communications as a full-time
                    employee. I was in a role that was particularly focused on
                    getting sales; there were other components as well, such as
                    tech support and relations, but theoretically the biggest
                    component of my paycheck was supposed to come from a
                    commission of the sales I made each month. That being said,
                    I gravitated towards more of a niche aspect of this: the
                    Deaf Community. You see, learning to communicate in ASL
                    helped me become a better communicator than I had otherwise
                    been, and communicating with the members of that community
                    came with ancillary benefits such as learning the programs
                    and policies legally allotted to those that needed or could
                    justify need for certain benefits, otherwise not known. As
                    time progressed, I started to form relationships with some
                    of the community, and began to grow in a number of ways that
                    would not have otherwise been afforded to me. In this way,
                    interacting with speakers of other languages, such as ASL, I
                    have learned a lot, beyond that just learning the language,
                    especially in helping people communicate with their loved
                    ones, regardless of circumstances like location. This has
                    been something that I feel very blessed to have done, and
                    would enjoy being able to help in even greater ways in the
                    future, regardless of the capacity; again, the ideal being
                    means being through communications, mobile engineering,
                    backend software engineering, or any of the other fields
                    mentioned.

                    table that I like to reference as it helps with learning
                    morse code; as the picture is not mine, please click the
                    picture for its original source. The video is one of a
                    handful I have done to help teach and remember origami. The
                    audio is from the Library of Congress; it has little
                    significance to me beyond the fact that I play oboe and I
                    like the song. It is of the age that it is in the Public
                    Domain, thus is both free to use and reuse, but as I am
                    finding it difficult to link to it's true site, here is the
                    audio file's cite (meaning citation, but I liked the play on
                    words): Dvořák, Antonín, et al. New World symphony: Largo.
